## Unsolved Problems / Major Hurdles

* Was not able to have player lose a life would like to work on that in the future.
* Was not able to show correct and all incorrect answers after player picked a answer to show what they got wrong or right.
* Work more on the UI design to give it more of a game feel and not just a basic trivia game.
